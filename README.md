# odin-recipes
# This is my first project following the curriculum at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes
# The purpose of this project is to create a simple website that contains links to a few cooking recipes.
# This README will be updated a final time at project completion explaining the new skills I have learned.
# Final README Update: Upon completion of this project I learned primarily how to create a clean workflow using Git, with commit that fully explain each change to the code, how to create a basic webpage that uses absolute and relative hyperlinks, and how to host a webpage for public view using GitHub.
